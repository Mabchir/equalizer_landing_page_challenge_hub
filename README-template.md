- how to position a background image:[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size)

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./assets/bg-main-desktop.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 0% 20%;
  background-size: cover;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

- how to make an image overflow: [CSS Trisck](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/overflow/)

```css
.container {
  overflow: hidden;
}

.img {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 40px;
}
```
